  GPIO outputs are used to control devices such as LEDs, relays, and other
  peripherals. The GPIO output driver is responsible for configuring the GPIO
  pins as outputs and controlling their state (high or low).

  For example:
  / {
      user_outputs: gpio-outputs {
          compatible = "gpio-outputs";
          usr_output_0 {
              label = "LED1";
              gpios = <&gpio0 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
          };
    };

compatible: "gpio-outputs"
